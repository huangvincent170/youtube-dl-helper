# youtube-dl-helper  

This script is intended to help format youtube autogenerated music downloaded with youtube-dl.  

Example of autogenerated music video:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPe0bX_GtBo  

Specifically, this tool embeds the youtube thumbnail into the file.
While youtube-dl does feature the --embed-thumbnail option,
it uses a low-quality version of the thumbnail which contains uncropped padding.
This script instead uses the first frame of the video hq.  

Example of original:  
![img](assets/example_original_embed_thumbnail.jpg)
  
High Quality:  
![img](assets/example_hq_embed_thumbnail.png)

Requirements:
youtube-dl
ffmpeg
eyed3
cv2
